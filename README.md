# Ninjaroo
The Kangaroo solver running in a background thread.
Sacrifices the interactivity of the original solver for the sake of running bigger models without freezing the UI thread.

# Dependencies
You'll need to reference the KangarooSolver.dll from the [Kangaroo plugin](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/kangaroo-physics) to build this component.
